# Week 3 Decentralized Authentication

## Required Homework

- Installed AWS Amplify
- Used AWS Cognito to generate a user pool and manually configure user identities for the signin page of the frontend application.
- Deleted the manually created user id and used the the `import {Auth} from 'aws-amplify';` code in the signupage.js & signinpage.js and also ConfirmationPage.js file to be able to register a user, i got a confirmation code that prompted an access to the cruddur mobile application.
- Initiated a forgot password, and that returned an email with a code for password reset.
The picture below is a snapshot of the email received for the confirmation code and password reset respectively.
